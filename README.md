# NETPUG
A project to be able to see how an attack can spread across a network using graphs. This will use Java 12, JavaFX12 
and my own implementation of a vertex. Edges will be calculated at the JavaFX level.

NETPUG stands for Network Threat Prevention Using Graphs and is a side project while I am on Summer Vacation from Uni.
It is to help me learn how to implement a lot of what I learnt in some Java and Maths modules I took this year and to
further my understanding.
